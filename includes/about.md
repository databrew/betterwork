# This application

This application is the product of a collaboration between Tufts University, Better Work, and the World Bank Group. 

# This survey

**Background**:  

Better Work is a joint program of the ILO/IFC that aims to improve working conditions in garment factories and help them achieve compliance with standards for global labor rights. Better Work functions through a joint management-worker committee and extensive factory trainings, advisory visits and assessments. 

**Data collection rounds**:

The Tufts Labor Lab has been conducting an impact evaluation of the Better Work program since 2010 in Haiti, Jordan, Indonesia, Nicaragua, and Vietnam. Data is collected in Better Work factories through surveys administered to workers and managers via tablet computer. Each survey features multiple translations, audio options for low literacy participants and tutorials for using the survey. Surveys are administered in a confidential space by third party data collectors and data features two layers of anonymity for worker safety and privacy. Between 10 and 30 workers are surveyed per factory per data collection round as well as the Human Resources Manager, General Manager, Industrial Engineer and Finance Manager. 

Each factory is surveyed at an initial baseline round (cycle 1) before receiving any Better Work intervention. Factories receive repeated follow-up data collection visits, though the number of rounds varies by factory. Factories have entered the program at varying times, so while a cycle 1 visit may have occurred in 2010 for one factory, it may have occurred in 2014 for another factory. In addition to the cycle variable, a year and month variable is included in the dataset. Data collection rounds generally occur at least one year apart, though some may be more. 

**Confidentiality:**

Every effort has been made to maintain confidentiality and anonymity in the data. A unique and confidential numerical identifier is assigned to each factory (tuftsid) and can be used to analyze panel data at the factory level. 


**Dataset**:

Datasets are constructed using a one to many merge. Each observation represents one worker at one point in time. Each of the four managers has been merged to the workers from their factory such that if 17 workers were surveyed in a factory, then the corresponding Human Resources Manager, General Manager, Industrial Engineer, and Financial Manager data will repeat 17 times for each of those workers.
